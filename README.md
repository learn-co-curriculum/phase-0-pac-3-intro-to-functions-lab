## Introduction

Welcome to the JavaScript functions lab! You'll notice a few new things in this
lesson that we haven't encountered before. Don't worry, we'll walk you through
them.

If you haven't already, fork and clone this lab into your local environment.
Remember to **fork** a copy into your GitHub account first, then **clone** from
that copy. Navigate into its directory in the terminal, then run `code .` to
open the files in Visual Studio Code. (If you are using a different code editor,
the command will be different.)

### Code-Along

To start, open up `index.js` in your text editor. You should see, well, nothing.
We'll fix that soon.

Now open up `test/root.js`. Hey, there's something! What's all of this stuff
doing?

At the very top of the file, you'll see

```js
global.expect = require("expect");

const babel = require("babel-core");
const jsdom = require("jsdom");
const path = require("path");
```

This might be a bit bewildering, but all we're doing is referencing different
_libraries_ that help us run the tests. You may recall that we talked about
_packages_ in an earlier lesson. A library is similar: it's code that someone
else (usually multiple someones) wrote for our use. The code above makes the
libraries available inside our test environment, which enables us to run the
tests.

If you go to `test/indexTest.js`, you'll see

```js
describe("shout(string)", function () {
  // there's stuff in here, too
});
```

`describe` is a function provided by our test runner (in this case, we're using
[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)) — it's basically a container for our tests.

Let's take a closer look at that `describe()`:

```js
describe("shout(string)", function () {
  it("receives one argument and returns it in all caps", function () {
    // we'll get to this in a sec
  });
});
```

These internal `describe()` calls are used for _describing_ the functions that
you're going to write. In this case, the test is saying, "Okay, I think there's
going to be a function called `shout`, and it should take one argument (it
doesn't actually matter what the argument is called, but `string`, is nice and
specific, don't you think?). It should _return_ that argument in all caps.

Finally, we have

```js
expect(shout("hello")).toEqual("HELLO");
```

which says that it _expects_ a call to `shout()` with the string `'hello'` will
`equal` the string `'HELLO'`. This is the actual test — otherwise called a spec,
expectation, or assertion — for this function. We can have more than one test
per function, but let's start with this one.

### Running the Tests

To run the tests, first run `npm install` in the terminal to install the
dependencies, then run `npm test`. The first output you'll see will look
something like this:

```console
$ npm test
> java-script-intro-to-functions-lab@0.1.0 test
> mocha --timeout 5000 -R mocha-multi --reporter-options spec=-,json=.results.json



  shout(string)
    1) receives one argument and returns it in all caps

  whisper(string)
    2) receives one argument and returns it in all lowercase

  logShout(string)
    3) takes a string argument and logs it in all caps using console.log()

  logWhisper(string)
    4) takes a string argument and logs it in all lowercase using console.log()

  sayHiToHeadphonedRoommate(string)
    5) returns "I can't hear you!" if `string` is lowercase
    6) returns "YES INDEED!" if `string` is uppercase
    7) returns "I would love to!" if `string` is "Let's have dinner together!"`


  0 passing (120ms)

      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:461:21)

  5) sayHiToHeadphonedRoommate(string)
       returns "I can't hear you!" if `string` is lowercase:

      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:461:21)

  6) sayHiToHeadphonedRoommate(string)
       returns "YES INDEED!" if `string` is uppercase:
     ReferenceError: sayHiToHeadphonedRoommate is not defined
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/indexTest.js:44:5)
      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:461:21)

  7) sayHiToHeadphonedRoommate(string)
       returns "I would love to!" if `string` is "Let's have dinner together!"`:
     ReferenceError: sayHiToHeadphonedRoommate is not defined
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/indexTest.js:48:5)
      at processImmediate (internal/timers.j
```

Hm, seven failed tests - that seems like a lot to navigate. Let's go ahead and
get Mocha set up to only show the first failing test. Find the test script in
the `package.json` file and add the `--bail` tag to the end:

```json
"test": "mocha --timeout 5000 -R mocha-multi --reporter-options spec=-,json=.results.json --bail"
```

Save the file and run the tests. You should now see something like this:

```console
$ npm test

> java-script-intro-to-functions-lab@0.1.0 test
> mocha --timeout 5000 -R mocha-multi --reporter-options spec=-,json=.results.json --bail



  shout(string)
    1) receives one argument and returns it in all caps

  0 passing (159ms)
  1 failing

  1) shout(string)
       receives one argument and returns it in all caps:
     ReferenceError: shout is not defined
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/indexTest.js:4:5)
      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:461:21)


```

Much better! Now let's see if we can get that first test to pass. Open up
`index.js`.

When we write our code, we follow the guidance of the tests. Let's take a look
at that first error:

```console
  1) shout(string)
       receives one argument and returns it in all caps:
     ReferenceError: shout is not defined
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/indexTest.js:4:5)
      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:461:21)
```

The output above comes from this test in `indexTest.js`:

```js
describe("shout(string)", function () {
  it("receives one argument and returns it in all caps", function () {
    expect(shout("hello")).toEqual("HELLO");
  });
});
```

We know that the test is expecting a function called `shout` that accepts an
argument. The error tells us that `shout` isn't defined. So let's start by
declaring our function in `index.js`:

```js
function shout(string) {
  // todo
}
```

We know we won't pass the test yet because our function doesn't do anything yet.
However, if we rerun the test, it should now give us more information about what
we need to do:

```console
  1) shout(string)
       receives one argument and returns it in all caps:
     Error: Expected undefined to equal 'HELLO'
      at assert (node_modules/expect/lib/assert.js:29:9)
      at Expectation.toEqual (node_modules/expect/lib/Expectation.js:81:30)
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/indexTest.js:4:28)
      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:461:21)
```

Anytime you see `Error: Expected undefined to equal [something]`, that means
that the test is looking for a `return` value. We can also see the description
of what the function should do: it `receives one argument and returns it in all caps`.

Okay, so with that information, we know that our function should return whatever
string is passed in as an argument:

```js
function shout(string) {
  return string;
}
```

But we're still missing one piece: how do we make `string` all caps? JavaScript
has a built-in method for that! It's called `toUpperCase()`. We can call it on
any string:

```js
"Hello!".toUpperCase(); // 'HELLO!'
```

Above, we've called it directly on a literal string but, of course, we can also
call it on a variable. So let's try it with our `shout()` function:

```js
function shout(string) {
  return string.toUpperCase();
}
```

and run our tests again. We get:

```console
  shout(string)
    ✓ receives one argument and returns it in all caps

  whisper(string)
    1) receives one argument and returns it in all lowercase

  1 passing (147ms)
  1 failing

  1) whisper(string)
       receives one argument and returns it in all lowercase:
     ReferenceError: whisper is not defined
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/indexTest.js:10:5)
      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:461:21)
```

Hey! We got one to pass! Time to tackle the next error!

## Your Turn

Now it's your turn to get the rest of the tests to pass. Note that some of them
require you to use `console.log()` instead of `return` — follow the guidance of
the tests!

### Instructions

In this lab, we're writing functions that "speak" at different volumes — they
whisper or they shout. The next test is similar to the first:

```console
1) whisper(string)
       receives one argument and returns it in all lowercase:
     ReferenceError: whisper is not defined
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/indexTest.js:10:5)
      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:456:21)
```

This test is telling us that `whisper(string)` receives one argument and returns
it in all lowercase. At the moment, the test is failing because whisper is not
defined.

> **Note:** Just like `.toUpperCase()` changes any string to all uppercase in
> JavaScript, `.toLowerCase()` (e.g., `'HELLO'.toLowerCase()`) changes any
> string to all lowercase.

After you get `whisper(string)` passing, the next two tests will be checking to
see if a specific string is logged when a function is called. You will still
need to use the `.toUpperCase()` and `.toLowerCase()` methods for
`logShout(string)` and `logWhisper(string)`. Keep in mind, though, that these
tests are not looking for return values, only logs.

The final function you need to create is `sayHiToHeadphonedRoommate()`. Your
roommate is very into their music, so whispering can be a bit difficult, but
they'll always hear you if you say, "Let's have dinner together!" This time,
you will need to return different strings depending on the string passed into
the function.

**Note:** Although there are 3 tests for `sayHiToHeadphonedRoommate()`, you only
need to write **one** function. This function should be able to handle all three
test conditions:

- If the string that is passed into the function is all lowercase, the function
  should return "I can't hear you!"
- If the string that is passed into the function is all uppercase, the function
  should return "YES INDEED!"
- If the string that is passed into the function is equal to "Let's have dinner
  together!", the function should return "I would love to!"

How do we check if a string is all lowercase or all uppercase? Let's take a look
using a REPL. Click on "Show files" and then the "index.js" file to see the code:

<iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://replit.com/@lizbur10/InsubstantialTanInternet?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>

In the first line we're defining a string variable. In the next two lines we log
the original variable, then the variable after calling `toUpperCase()` on it.
Finally, we're checking to see whether those two values are equal. If you click
the Run button, you'll see that the original string is mixed case and the upper
cased version of it is (not surprisingly) uppercase. It should not come as a
surprise, therefore, that comparing them with the equality operator (`===`)
returns false. What do you think will happen if we initialize `string` to
"HELLO!" instead? Play around with different values for `string` in [replit][]
and see what happens. Also try doing the same thing with `toLowerCase()` and
make sure you understand what's happening.

Basically, if we compare a string to its uppercased (or lowercased) version and
the two values are equal, then we know that the original string is uppercase (or
lowercase). So now that we know how to make these comparisons, how can we use
them to conditionally return different strings? If you need a refresher, go back
and review the lesson on Selection with Conditionals.

Remember that punctuation is important! Humans might be able to understand that
"Lets have dinner together" is close enough to "Let's have dinner together!" and
means the same thing, but JavaScript will not consider these equal!

**Reminder:** As you're working through the tests, you can run your code by
running `node index.js` in the terminal. If you want to do this, remember that
you'll need to _call_ the function inside `index.js`. If you are just running
tests, however, you don't need to include a function call — the tests will
handle that for you.

After you have all the tests passing, remember to commit and push your changes
up to GitHub, then submit your work to Canvas using CodeGrade. If you need a
reminder, go back to the [Complete Your First Software Engineering
Assignment][complete-assignment] lesson to review the process.
